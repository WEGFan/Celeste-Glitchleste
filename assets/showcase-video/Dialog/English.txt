    # CH6_THEO_SAY_EXPLAIN

    [THEO left wtf]
    Clearly this isn't a normal {+MOUNTAIN}.
    What's really going on here?

    [MADELINE right sad]
    I should've told you sooner.

    [MADELINE right distracted]
    Back at the old ruins, a...{n}{+PART_OF_ME} escaped from a mirror.
    A part I'm not very proud of.

    [MADELINE right upset]
    I swear I dreamt it.

    [THEO left serious]
    You think the {+MOUNTAIN} made her real?

    [MADELINE right distracted]
    Yeah. She's been haunting me the whole time.

    [MADELINE right sad]
    She lashed out at {+MROSHIRO}.

    [MADELINE right distracted]
    I think she was the reason the gondola stalled out.

    [MADELINE right sad]
    And she was there, in the temple.

    # CH6_THEO_SAY_DEPRESSION

    [THEO left normal]
    This {+PART_OF_YOU} that's haunting you,{n}maybe she comes with the territory.

    [MADELINE right upset]
    So you think I'm stuck with her forever?

    [THEO left normal]
    Well, she's stuck with you, too.

    [MADELINE right upset]
    That's {*}not{/*} helpful.

    # CH6_THEO_SAY_DEFENSE

    [THEO left wtf]
    So you want to destroy this {+PART_OF_YOU}?
    Won't that hurt you, too?

    [MADELINE right sad]
    If I don't she's just going to keep bullying me.

    [MADELINE right upset]
    She says she's protecting me,{n}but that's obviously not true.

    [THEO left normal]
    Maybe she thinks she is.
    She could be some kind of...{n}twisted defense mechanism.

    [MADELINE right upset]
    Honestly, who cares?
    She has so much control over me.
    I hate it.

    [THEO left wtf]
    Maybe you can learn to control her instead.

    [MADELINE right distracted]
    The feather helps a lot.

    [MADELINE right sad]
    Thanks for teaching me that.

    [THEO left thinking]
    Just one of my grandpa's many nuggets of wisdom.

    # CH6_THEO_SAY_SELFIE

    [MADELINE right normal]
    You know what?
    I want to remember this night...
    Let's take a selfie!

    [THEO left normal]
    I thought you'd never ask.

    {trigger 0 selfie sequence}

    [MADELINE right normal]
    Y'know despite everything,{n}I feel pretty good right now.

    [THEO left wtf]
    Wait a second...

    [THEO left excited]
    You're going to reach the summit tomorrow!

    [MADELINE right upset]
    Don't jinx it.

    [MADELINE right distracted]
    ...yeah, I'm excited.

    [MADELINE right normal]
    I'm ready to put this all behind me.

    [THEO left normal]
    I'll be cheering you on.
    We should get some sleep.

    [MADELINE right normal]
    Okay, goodnight, {+THEO}.

    [MADELINE right distracted]
    Thanks for... being cool.

    [THEO left thinking]
    What can I say? It comes naturally.
