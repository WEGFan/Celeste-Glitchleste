This folder contains files I used to make the [showcase video](https://youtu.be/B7qC5uzu76w).

If you want to replay it for some reason, you need to:

- Install [CelesteTAS](https://gamebanana.com/tools/6715)
- Clone this repository and build the mod in Debug configuration
- Copy the files in `Dialog` folder to mod's `Dialog` folder
- Enable `Showcase Video Modifications` in Mod Options
- Load the file corresponding to your game's language in Celeste Studio
